Gezelvirus workflow
===================

The repository contains the bioinformatic workflow used in the paper Roitman et al (2023) "Infection cycle and phylogeny of a Polinton-like virus with a virophage lifestyle infecting *Phaeocystis globosa*". See also results and additional data in the [figshare repository](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21294852.v1).

The workflow is built using [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/). Dependencies are under the control of conda (see `--use-conda`). Run as `snakemake --cores 10 --use-conda` -- that will provide further instructions.
